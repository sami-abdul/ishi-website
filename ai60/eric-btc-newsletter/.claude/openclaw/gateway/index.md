# Gateway Runbook

Use this page for day-1 startup and day-2 operations of the Gateway service.

## Quick Reference Cards

Four essential operational guides are available:

- **Deep troubleshooting**: Symptom-first diagnostics with exact command ladders and log signatures.
- **Configuration**: Task-oriented setup guide plus full configuration reference.
- **Secrets management**: SecretRef contract, runtime snapshot behavior, and migrate/reload operations.
- **Secrets plan contract**: Exact `secrets apply` target/path rules and ref-only auth-profile behavior.

## 5-minute local startup

**Step 1: Start the Gateway**
```bash
openclaw gateway --port 18789
# debug/trace mirrored to stdio
openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose
# force-kill listener on selected port, then start
openclaw gateway --force
```

**Step 2: Verify service health**
```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw status
openclaw logs --follow
```

Healthy baseline: `Runtime: running` and `RPC probe: ok`.

**Step 3: Validate channel readiness**
```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
```

**Note**: Gateway config reload watches the active config file path (resolved from profile/state defaults, or `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` when set). Default mode is `gateway.reload.mode="hybrid"`.

## Runtime model

- One always-on process for routing, control plane, and channel connections.
- Single multiplexed port for WebSocket control/RPC, HTTP APIs (OpenAI-compatible, Responses, tools invoke), and Control UI and hooks.
- Default bind mode: `loopback`.
- Auth is required by default (`gateway.auth.token` / `gateway.auth.password`, or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` / `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`).

### Port and bind precedence

| Setting | Resolution order |
|---------|-----------------|
| Gateway port | `--port` -> `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` -> `gateway.port` -> `18789` |
| Bind mode | CLI/override -> `gateway.bind` -> `loopback` |

### Hot reload modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `off` | No config reload |
| `hot` | Apply only hot-safe changes |
| `restart` | Restart on reload-required changes |
| `hybrid` (default) | Hot-apply when safe, restart when required |

## Operator command set

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw gateway status --deep
openclaw gateway status --json
openclaw gateway install
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw gateway stop
openclaw secrets reload
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw doctor
```

## Remote access

Preferred: Tailscale/VPN.
Fallback: SSH tunnel.

```bash
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host
```

Then connect clients to `ws://127.0.0.1:18789` locally.

**Warning**: If gateway auth is configured, clients still must send auth (`token`/`password`) even over SSH tunnels.

## Supervision and service lifecycle

Use supervised runs for production-like reliability.

### macOS (launchd)
```bash
openclaw gateway install
openclaw gateway status
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw gateway stop
```

LaunchAgent labels are `ai.openclaw.gateway` (default) or `ai.openclaw.<profile>` (named profile). `openclaw doctor` audits and repairs service config drift.

### Linux (systemd user)
```bash
openclaw gateway install
systemctl --user enable --now openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service
openclaw gateway status
```

For persistence after logout, enable lingering:
```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>
```

### Linux (system service)
Use a system unit for multi-user/always-on hosts.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service
```

## Multiple gateways on one host

Most setups should run **one** Gateway.
Use multiple only for strict isolation/redundancy (for example a rescue profile).

Checklist per instance:

- Unique `gateway.port`
- Unique `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`
- Unique `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`
- Unique `agents.defaults.workspace`

Example:

```bash
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.openclaw/a.json OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.openclaw-a openclaw gateway --port 19001
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.openclaw/b.json OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.openclaw-b openclaw gateway --port 19002
```

See: [Multiple gateways](/gateway/multiple-gateways).

### Dev profile quick path

```bash
openclaw --dev setup
openclaw --dev gateway --allow-unconfigured
openclaw --dev status
```

Defaults include isolated state/config and base gateway port `19001`.

## Protocol quick reference (operator view)

- First client frame must be `connect`.
- Gateway returns `hello-ok` snapshot (`presence`, `health`, `stateVersion`, `uptimeMs`, limits/policy).
- Requests: `req(method, params)` -> `res(ok/payload|error)`.
- Common events: `connect.challenge`, `agent`, `chat`, `presence`, `tick`, `health`, `heartbeat`, `shutdown`.

Agent runs are two-stage:

1. Immediate accepted ack (`status:"accepted"`)
2. Final completion response (`status:"ok"|"error"`), with streamed `agent` events in between.

See full protocol docs: [Gateway Protocol](/gateway/protocol).

## Operational checks

### Liveness

- Open WS and send `connect`.
- Expect `hello-ok` response with snapshot.

### Readiness

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw channels status --probe
openclaw health
```

### Gap recovery

Events are not replayed. On sequence gaps, refresh state (`health`, `system-presence`) before continuing.

## Common failure signatures

| Signature | Likely issue |
|-----------|--------------|
| `refusing to bind gateway ... without auth` | Non-loopback bind without token/password |
| `another gateway instance is already listening` / `EADDRINUSE` | Port conflict |
| `Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local` | Config set to remote mode |
| `unauthorized` during connect | Auth mismatch between client and gateway |

For full diagnosis ladders, use [Gateway Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting).

## Safety guarantees

- Gateway protocol clients fail fast when Gateway is unavailable (no implicit direct-channel fallback).
- Invalid/non-connect first frames are rejected and closed.
- Graceful shutdown emits `shutdown` event before socket close.
