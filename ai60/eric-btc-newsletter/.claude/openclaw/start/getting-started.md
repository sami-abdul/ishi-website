# Getting Started

Goal: go from zero to a first working chat with minimal setup.

**Fastest chat:** open the Control UI (no channel setup needed). Run `openclaw dashboard` and chat in the browser, or open `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` on the gateway host. Docs: [Dashboard](/web/dashboard) and [Control UI](/web/control-ui).

## Prereqs

* Node 22 or newer

Check your Node version with `node --version` if you are unsure.

## Quick setup (CLI)

### Step 1: Install OpenClaw (recommended)

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Other install methods and requirements: [Install](/install).

### Step 2: Run the onboarding wizard
```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

The wizard configures auth, gateway settings, and optional channels. See [Onboarding Wizard](/start/wizard) for details.

### Step 3: Check the Gateway
If you installed the service, it should already be running:
```bash
openclaw gateway status
```

### Step 4: Open the Control UI
```bash
openclaw dashboard
```

If the Control UI loads, your Gateway is ready for use.

## Optional checks and extras

**Run the Gateway in the foreground:**
Useful for quick tests or troubleshooting.
```bash
openclaw gateway --port 18789
```

**Send a test message:**
Requires a configured channel.
```bash
openclaw message send --target +15555550123 --message "Hello from OpenClaw"
```

## Useful environment variables

If you run OpenClaw as a service account or want custom config/state locations:

* `OPENCLAW_HOME` sets the home directory used for internal path resolution.
* `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` overrides the state directory.
* `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` overrides the config file path.

Full environment variable reference: [Environment vars](/help/environment).

* [macOS app onboarding](/start/onboarding) - First run flow for the macOS app.

## What you will have

* A running Gateway
* Auth configured
* Control UI access or a connected channel
